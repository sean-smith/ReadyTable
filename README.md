ReadyTable
==========

This is a web app that allows restaurant owners to create an online based table wait list. They enter the party size, name, and number of the party. The party then gets placed in a queue. When a spot opens up they can "dequeue" a party which will remove them from the wait list and send a text to the party informing them that their table is ready.

This app ensures that you never miss your table. Rather than waiting in a crowded restaurant, you can visit nearby shops and art galleries. Restaurants benefit from increased wait list retention and a capacity to deliver from better overall service.
